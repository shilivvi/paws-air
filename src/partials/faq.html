            <p class="h5">Flight costs vary depending on fuel rates and the demand on charter planes at the time of flying. Expect to pay $2,500 USD+ for a one-way ticket for you and your pet.</p>

            <p class="h5">There are multiple factors that drive up the cost. First, we do not overload the plane, which makes the experience less stressful for pets and their hoomans. Second, we book smaller jets, which makes it more likely that the plane will be filled, and the flight will proceed. That means we cannot achieve nearly the same economy of scale of much larger planes with many more passengers (you would need 8-9 flight attendants on a typical commercial flight to reach the same passenger: attendant ratio as on our flights!). Third, our planes must undergo a thorough deep cleaning after every flight, as they are also chartered for non-pet flights (sad!). Finally, our planes are mostly empty on the return leg of the journey because of load demand at that time of year. We are working hard to address this imbalance, with the goal of passing those savings on to our loyal customers. Every dollar saved is another dollar spent on chew toys and pet treats, so we take this work very seriously!</p>

            <p class="h5">We do not run regularly scheduled commercial flights, but rather specialized flights during high-demand periods. Thus, we need lead-time to procure the planes that will take to the furry skies. We need to secure the planes 30 days in advance, which is why we require booking and payment of seats at least 30 days in advance. </p>

          <div class="faq__answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p class="h5">Given that we must procure and pay for planes 30 days in advance and to ensure that other passengers who have booked on the same flight will get to their destination, we cannot provide a refund (that wouldn’t be fair to the rest of our passengers and their hoomans). Once the plane is procured, the flight will proceed regardless of any passengers who are not present for the departure time. For this reason, it is extremely important that you are 100% certain you are going to fly before booking your flight. After booking, no refunds will be provided unless there is a mechanical breakdown of the airplane (in which case an alternate flight will be offered) or an Act of God that prevents the flight from departing (in which case a full refund will be provided).  </p>
